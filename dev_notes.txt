A Q&A bot for Python knowledge

Procedure for building up the bot:
* Prepare a training set of Python knowledge by crawling docs.python.org/2/
** Run url2text.py, which generates raw_text.txt. (The visited URLs are also pickled for restarting.)

* Break texts into 'sentences' by cutting at 'comma/period+whitespace' or end-of-line. Process each sentence by stemming, etc. 
** Run text2sentence.py, which generates sentences.txt.

* Use word2vec to map words in sentences.txt to vectors of some dimension
** Run word2vec_train.py, which saves the model to word2vec_model.sav

* Prepare a Q&A dataset, each item being a question-answer pair. Multiple questions can have the same answer. (Let k = # of answers)

* Define some syntactic rules to preprocess questions and convert them to a set of words; map those words to vectors; add up the vectors to get an input vector for each question. Continue training the word2vec model on these questions. 
** Use the same procedure as to process sentences. 

* Train a neural network for question-input-vector -> k-dim answer vector
** Run NN_train.py, which saves the NN to NN.pickle.

* Use the NN to predict answers given a question. 
** Run NN_predict.py.
