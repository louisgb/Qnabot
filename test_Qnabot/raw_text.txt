To download an archive containing all the documents for
this version of Python in one of various formats, follow one of links
in this table. The numbers in the table are the size of the download
files in megabytes.
These archives contain all the content in the
documentation.
HTML Help
(.chm) files are made available in the "Windows" section
on the Python download page
Unix users should download the .tar.bz2 archives; these
are bzipped tar archives and can be handled in the usual way using tar
and the bzip2 program. The InfoZIP unzip
program can be used to handle the ZIP archives if desired. The
.tar.bz2 archives provide the best compression and fastest download
times.
Windows users can use the ZIP archives since those are
customary on that platform. These are created on Unix using the
InfoZIP zip program.
If you have comments or suggestions for the Python

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl/) in the Netherlands as a
successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python’s principal author,
although it includes many contributions from others.
In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National
Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us/) in Reston,
Virginia where he released several versions of the software.
In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to
form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same year, the PythonLabs
team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope Corporation; see
http://www.zope.com/).  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization created
specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a
sponsoring member of the PSF.
All Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org/ for the Open
Source Definition). Historically, most, but not all, Python releases have also
been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes the various releases.
Note
GPL-compatible doesn’t mean that we’re distributing Python under the GPL.  All
Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute a modified version without
making your changes open source. The GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to
combine Python with other software that is released under the GPL; the others
don’t.
Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido’s direction to
make these releases possible.
